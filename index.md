## What are GAP Days

[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and
users  with GAP  programming  experience are  invited  to influence  the
future development  of GAP.  To streamline  each meeting  the organizers
usually suggest a few main topics to work on during the week.

## Main topic: Matrices in GAP

During these  GAP Days we  want to  concentrate on a  somewhat technical
topic  in  the  core  part  of GAP:  *matrix  objects*.  See  the  [Main
topic](10_topic/) page for more details.

Therefore, this  meeting is mainly  intended for developers of  core GAP
who are interested in this  main topic. Nevertheless, other participants
who want to contribute are most welcome. And, of course, suggestions for
further topics are welcome as well.

See  [GAP   Days  Fall   2017](https://www.gapdays.de/gapdays2017-fall/)  for
further  GAP Days  which  address    wider  ranges  of participants  and
topics.
